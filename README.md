This project is based on React's official Tic Tac Toe tutorial. 

I choose to use Typescript in the development to challenge myself. Also, i had my first contact with ESLint and Prettier.
My first React deployment was succesfull and the result is here: https://tic-tac-toe-lilac-iota.vercel.app/

Soon this project will be updated with Styled Components.

It's been a great adventure!
